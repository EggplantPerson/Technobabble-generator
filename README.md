# Technobabble-generator

This file is meant to be used as a library, currently it includes 2 dictionaries for storing the words that are used when generating phrases.

The first is for verbs and the second for nouns
If you want to change any of the words I recommend to write the verbs in present continuous form
and the nouns in plural form to keep the program simple.

To implement it into a program just call the function jargon()

I hope you enjoy
